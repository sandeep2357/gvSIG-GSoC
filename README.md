<h3>Add Raster Support to scripting in gvSIG</h3>
<hr/>
The project aim is to implement support for GIS raster data formats in gvSIG 2.0 scripting framework. The scripting extension will be able to let users perform several raster analysis functions (geoprocessing, filters, flow direction analysis etc). By the time of completion of this project, one can work on a wide range of GIS raster data formats in gvSIG 2.0 scripting framework.
